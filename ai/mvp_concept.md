### Main Problem
When maintaining a gardener's journal, the problem is searching for entries from a longer period of time. This often requires "clicking through" several months back to find specific information, which discourages users from keeping the journal.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
-Adding entries to the journal<br>
-Viewing, editing, and deleting entries<br>
-Simple user account system for storing entries<br>
-AI search for added entries<br>

### What is NOT included in the MVP scope
-Adding categories/tags to entries<br>
-Sharing entries between users<br>
-Integrations with other external platforms<br>
-Mobile applications (web only initially)<br>


### Success Criteria
80% of users utilize the AI search
